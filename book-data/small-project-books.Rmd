# 1. REPORT 

I download the file Library-small.rda from the URL "http://tiny.cc/dcf/Library-small.rda"

## 2. Basics
First of all, we load the sample of books that we downloaded from the URL. Entry in R will look like this:
```{r}
load("Library-small.rda")

```
## 3.Cases
We will calculate the number of cases in Library's collection of books, and individual books that might or might not be in the library's collection. Commands in R go as followed

```{r num_cases}
nrow(Inv)
nrow(Bks)
```
Each result of each function is shown. From there, we can deduce that: 
number of books in Library's collection is 2000 books while individual books amount to 3765. 

## 4.Variables
Next, We want to calculate the number of variables using the following code lines in R

```{r message=FALSE, warning =FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}

str(Inv)
str(Bks)

```
From the information given in these commands, there are:

* 18 variables in Library's collection
* 15 variables in total collection of books

Each data table for Library's collection and individual books can be described as followed:

* In Library's collection, the data table shows detailed information of books, such as shelving location, Item type, Call Number, etc.
* in Individual books' collection, data table shows information such as OCLC Number, Format, Subjetc, Title, Author, etc.

## 5. Number of books with respect to current statuses
We will look at the number of books in their respective current status by inputting the following command in R

```{r current_stats,echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```
And this produces the following result
```{r ref.label= 'current_stats', echo=FALSE}
```
From this, we can deduce that:
  
* 1866 books are currently available
* 1 book is currently missing
* 18 books are  currently on loan
* 115 have currently been withdrawn

## 6. times books have been checked out
We use the following to investigate the number of times certain books have been checked out
``` {r times_checkout, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
```
And the result that follows is 
``` {r ref.label='times_checkout', echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
```

The results show the total books left for a particular title. The "title count" here indicates the number of issues for a particular book, for example the book "300" by author "Gianni Nunnari" has 92 issues left, while "Sydney Brenner : a biography" of author Errol C.Friedberg doesn't have any issues left (0 issue)
